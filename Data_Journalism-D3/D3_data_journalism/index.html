          <p>The relationship between lack of healthcare, percentage of smokers, and obesity percentage
            is compared to poverty percentage, median age and median household income for all states in the U.S.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="a"> 
          <p>These correlations can be visualized by the graph. For exmaple, when comparing lack of healthcare to poverty, the data is
            spread across the graph, meaning that there is no direct relationship between percentage of poverty and percentage of people
            lacking healthcare. This can be attributed to Medicaid and Medicare programs that are available for people with limited resources.
            Similarly, there is no direct correlation between median household income and percentage of people lacking healthcare. This can be attributed
            to people with higher incomes being able to afford commercial health insurance policies. 
            On the other hand, for most states, people who lack healthcare are within the age range of 36 - 40.

        <div class="a">
          <p>Percentage of smokers and percentage of obesity show similar results. There is no direct correlation between percentage of smokers, or obesity 
            percentage, and the percentage of poverty and/or median household income. Also, those states with the highest percentage of smokers (or obesity percentage), 
            have the highest percentage of poverty and the lowest median household income.  Again, for most states, people who smoke (or those considered obese) 
            are within the age range of 36 - 40.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="a">
           <p> In conclusion, people in states with a higher poverty percentage (or lower household income) are more prone to obesity and smoking,
             even though healthcare is accessible across most states and most household incomes. However, in most states, health risks such as obesity, smoking and 
            lack of healthcare are higher for people within the age range of 36-40.  </p>
